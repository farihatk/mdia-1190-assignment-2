# mdia-1190-assignment-2
A repo for assignment 2 of MDIA 1190 Web Technologies

This is a project inspired by how I would like to design my portfolio in the future. While I might not have blogs in my portfolio, I explored putting posts in a grid on the home page as I would in my actual portfolio. Though, I may opt for a more masonary grid in the future. Alas, I do not have that skillset or patience to do that yet c: 

Instructions to view blog homepage:
1. click link to repo
2. pull repo
3. go live on VS code
